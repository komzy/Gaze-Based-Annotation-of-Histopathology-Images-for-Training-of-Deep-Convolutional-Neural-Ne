## Qupath Scripts

1) CSV_to_Qupath.groovy: Imports all "Level xx" CSVs in a directory generated by our Gaze Annotation Software <link> into Qupath creation "Point" annotation objects. 

2) Qupath_to_CSV.groovy: Reverse of CSV_to_Qupath.groovy. Exports Point annotations from Qupath to CSV. A CSV is generated 
for each zoom level that can be opened by our gaze visualizer. Only "Point" objects are exported.

3) Qupath_Merge_Levels.groovy: Scales up all the points on  various zoom levels to the highest zoom level and merges them on the highest zoom level. Then generates a "Level <max_level>" CSV.
