Qupath Scripts:

1) CSV_to_Qupath.groovy: Imports all "Level xx" CSVs in a directory generated by our Gaze Annotation Software <link> into Qupath creation "Point" annotation objects.

2) Qupath_to_CSV.groovy: Reverse of CSV_to_Qupath.groovy. Exports Point annotations from Qupath to CSV. A CSV is generated 
for each zoom level that can be opened by our gaze visualizer. Only "Point" objects are exported.

3) Merge_Levels_CSV.groovy: Scales up all the points on  various zoom levels to the highest zoom level and merges them on the highest zoom level. Then generates a "Level <max_level>" CSV. 

Python Scripts:

1) generate_tfrecord.py: convert dataset images and annotation csvs to .tfrecord
